  <h3 class="proj">Fast and Reliable File Transfer Protocol using TCP
  </h3>
  <p class="lang">Technology: <a>C, Kernel Programming, TCP/IP</a></p>
  </br>
  <p class="desc">
  Hacked the Network Component of Linux Kernel Module  and removed
  exponential backoff from TCP Reno and altered the mechanism for
  controlling the congestion window size . We achieved a throughput of 10Mbs in a 100mbps link with RTT of 200ms
  and Loss rate of 20% using TCP.

    target="_blank">git@dan-boa/uftp</a>
</h3>
  <p class="lang">Technology: <a>C, UDP</a></p>
  </br>
  <p class="desc">
  Implemented a Fast and Reliable File Transfer Protocol on top of UDP. Using the Protocol we transferred a 1Gb file reliably in a high latency
  and lossy link.

  <h3 class="proj">Custom Network Protocol
    <a href="https://github.com/dan-boa/cnrouter"
    target="_blank">git@dan-boa/cnrouter</a>
  </h3>
  <p class="lang">Technology: <a>C, UDP</a></p>
  </br>
  <p class="desc">
  Developed a Custom Network Protocol like TCP/UDP but reliable and
  faster.The protocol has custom packet header , and custom payload size. The protocol supports 10000s of nodes. We tested our custom File Transfer Protocol to transfer a 10MB file
  between nodes.

  <h3 class="proj">Custom Router in User Space
    <a href="https://github.com/dan-boa/crouter"
    target="_blank">git@dan-boa/crouter</a>
  </h3>
  <p class="lang">Technology: <a>C, UDP</a></p>
  </br>
  <p class="desc">
  In this project we built an IP router in user space.The router supported packet forwarding , dynamic routing and correct
  response for various ICMP messages. For Dynamic Routing we implemented a RIP daemon , which would enable the custom router to accept routing packets from the other routers, in our case it is Quagga router and send routing packets to the other routers.

    target="_blank">git@dan-boa/ntp_router</a>
  </h3>
  <p class="lang">Technology: <a>C, UDP</a></p>
  </br>
  <p class="desc">
  Developed a Custom Network Time Protocol(CNTP) in C
  which enable synchronization of time between nodes
  over a network. We follow a client-server model in
  which Server broadcasts its time and the Clients sync
  their time with that of Server. CNTP offers improvement
  over NTP(Network Time Protocol)v4 by calculating end-to-end
  delay for the links between the nodes rather than assuming
  that outgoing and incoming paths between the nodes are symmetric.
  Timestamping of packets is done at the Kernel Driver level.
